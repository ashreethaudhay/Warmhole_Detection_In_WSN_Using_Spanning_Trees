# Warmhole_Detection_In_WSN_Using_Spanning_Trees
This project implements a wormhole detection algorithm for wireless sensor networks using spanning trees. It allows generating sensor networks with different deployment models and communication models, inserting wormholes into the networks, and then detecting the wormholes.
